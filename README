ChatServ v0.5

I do not know exactly where I pulled the original source. Itâ€™s been modified to fit
the use as described below. I may revisit this program at a later date.

This server is designed for small scale use for private chat clients. The server is only
a repeater of the data between the clients. While ChatServ does echo the comm data
to the console, it does not log any information (data, connections, timestamps, etc). 

This was meant to be a lightweight server that keeps no logs of the data or conversations
between each client. It allows rebroadcast to every node. The chat client is the workhorse
of the network and determines which messages to drop, display, encrypt, etc. etc.

While this is an unusual way to handle traffic, the end project is only meant for 
point-to-point encrypted conversations. A participent must have the correct 
encryption keys to view the conversation. It also prevents logging on the remote
server.
